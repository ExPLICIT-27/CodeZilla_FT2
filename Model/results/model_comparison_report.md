Model Performance Comparison Report
==================================

This report compares the performance of the Baseline Linear Regression model
and the XGBoost model on the corrected financial dataset.

Dataset Information:
- Total samples: 3,000
- Total features after preprocessing: 48 (includes engineered features and one-hot encoded categorical variables)
- Training set: 1,800 samples (60%)
- Validation set: 600 samples (20%)  
- Test set: 600 samples (20%)

Features include:
- Demographics: age, state, education_level, employment_type
- Employment: employment_stability_months
- Financial: monthly_income, monthly_rent, monthly_cashflow, minimum_bank_balance, monthly_savings
- Payment behavior: rent/utility/phone/insurance/subscription payment consistency
- Other: num_subscriptions, savings_goal_completion_rate, p2p_monthly_volume, risky_p2p_ratio, monthly_overdrafts
- Engineered features: overall_payment_reliability, income_to_rent_ratio, financial_cushion, savings_efficiency, risk_behavior_score, employment_stability_ratio

Model Performance Comparison:
============================

## Baseline Linear Regression Model
- Test R²: 0.8605
- Test RMSE: 15.33
- Test MAE: 11.23
- Training R²: 0.8835
- Validation R²: 0.8767

## XGBoost Model (with hyperparameter tuning)
- Test R²: 0.9274 ⭐ (+7.8% improvement)
- Test RMSE: 11.06 ⭐ (-27.9% improvement)
- Test MAE: 8.10 ⭐ (-27.9% improvement)
- Training R²: 0.9933
- Validation R²: 0.9397

Key Improvements with XGBoost:
==============================

1. **Better Predictive Accuracy**: 
   - R² improved from 0.8605 to 0.9274 (+7.8 percentage points)
   - RMSE reduced from 15.33 to 11.06 (-27.9% reduction in prediction error)
   
2. **Advanced Feature Learning**: 
   - XGBoost can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions
   - Tree-based model can handle complex patterns that linear regression misses
   
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Used RandomizedSearchCV with 50 parameter combinations
   - Optimal parameters: n_estimators=300, max_depth=4, learning_rate=0.1
   
4. **Better Generalization**:
   - Validation R² of 0.9397 vs 0.8767 for baseline
   - Less overfitting with proper regularization (reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=1)

Top Contributing Features (from Linear Regression coefficients):
===============================================================

**Negative Impact on Credit Score:**
- employment_type_unemployed: -49.64
- employment_type_gig: -32.22  
- employment_type_self_employed: -19.63
- employment_type_part_time: -13.28

**Positive Impact on Credit Score:**
- monthly_income: +8.83
- loan_approval_Yes: +8.05
- savings_goal_completion_rate: +6.26
- employment_stability_months: +5.32
- rent_payment_consistency: +5.09

Business Insights:
==================

1. **Employment Type is Critical**: 
   - Full-time employment significantly boosts credit scores
   - Unemployed status has the strongest negative impact (-49.64)
   
2. **Income and Stability Matter**: 
   - Higher monthly income directly correlates with better credit scores
   - Employment stability (months) is a strong positive predictor
   
3. **Payment Consistency is Key**: 
   - Consistent rent payments strongly predict creditworthiness
   - Overall payment reliability across utilities, phone, insurance matters
   
4. **Financial Planning Indicates Responsibility**:
   - Higher savings goal completion rates predict better credit scores
   - This suggests disciplined financial behavior

Recommendations:
===============

1. **For Production**: Use XGBoost model for better accuracy (92.7% vs 86.1% R²)
2. **Feature Engineering**: The engineered features (payment reliability, financial ratios) add value
3. **Monitoring**: Track model performance on new data, especially employment type distributions
4. **Fairness**: Review state-level coefficients to ensure no geographic bias
