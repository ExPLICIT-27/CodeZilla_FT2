# Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 Compliance Guide

## Overview
The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) is India's primary data protection legislation that governs the processing of personal data. This guide outlines compliance requirements for credit scoring applications.

## Key Definitions

### Personal Data
Any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data, including:
- Financial information (income, expenses, payment history)

- Official identifier (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.)

## Core Principles

### 1. Lawfulness of Processing
Personal data can only be processed for:
- **Legitimate Business Purpose**: Credit assessment and risk evaluation
- **Consent**: Voluntary and informed agreement from data principal
- **Legal Obligation**: Compliance with RBI and other regulatory requirements

### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Data must be processed only for the specified, explicit purpose
- Credit scoring data cannot be used for unrelated purposes

   - Regular training and certification
   - Direct reporting to senior management
   - Independence in decision-making

2. **Staff Training and Awareness**:
   - Regular privacy training programs

   - Regular vendor security assessments
   - Contractual privacy obligations
   - Incident notification requirements

## Data Breach Management

### Breach Response Procedures
1. **Detection and Assessment** (within 72 hours):
   - Immediate breach identification
   - Impact assessment and classification

2. **Notification Requirements**:
   - Data Protection Board notification (within 72 hours)
   - Data principal notification (without undue delay)
   - Documentation of breach and response actions

3. **Remediation and Recovery**:
   - System security restoration
   - Additional safeguards implementation
   - Lessons learned and process improvement

### Breach Documentation Template
```

3. **Progressive Profiling**: Build profiles gradually over time
4. **Consent Renewal**: Regular consent validation and renewal

### Data Processing Best Practices
1. **Purpose Binding**: Strict adherence to declared purposes
2. **Automated Decision-Making**: Human oversight for adverse decisions
3. **Explainability**: Clear explanation of scoring factors
4. **Bias Prevention**: Regular fairness and bias assessments

### Data Storage Best Practices
1. **Data Classification**: Categorize data by sensitivity level
2. **Encrypted Storage**: End-to-end encryption implementation
3. **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
4. **Automated Deletion**: Policy-based data lifecycle management

## Integration with Credit Scoring Workflow

### Consent Integration Points
```python
# Example consent validation in preprocessing
def validate_consent_before_processing(user_id, data_categories):
    consent_status = get_user_consent(user_id)
    for category in data_categories:
        if not consent_status.get(category, {}).get('granted', False):
            raise ConsentException(f"No valid consent for {category}")
        if consent_status[category]['expires'] < datetime.now():
            raise ConsentException(f"Expired consent for {category}")
    return True
```

### Data Subject Rights Integration
```python
# Example data access request handler
def handle_data_access_request(user_id, request_type):
    if request_type == 'access':
        return get_user_data_summary(user_id)
    elif request_type == 'correction':
        return initiate_data_correction_workflow(user_id)
    elif request_type == 'deletion':
        return process_data_deletion_request(user_id)
```
